# Code Review
A repository to submit, review, discuss and share code. Refer to the description below for more info.

For now it's open for JavaScript (or any other frontend stack language) only.

## Motivation

Code review is the one of the crucial processes for ensuring the spread of knowledge transfer and best practices throughout a development team.
Typically, the code review process should consist of these steps:
* Finding obvious mistakes (typos, missing/extra blank lines or spaces, poor variable or function names, large function definitions)
* Deep contextual pass (tests, unhandled edge cases, logical omissions or errors)

## Schedule

TBD

## Submitting code for review

The first thing that should be done before submitting the code is determining what actually you want to be reviewed. **Don't submit the whole project** — in most cases you might only need to select diff and files that it affects.

Here's also two kinds of review requests: one is, as described above, submission of the diff only. 
Another one suitable for situations when you'd like to submit the diff of your public (e.g. open source) project — simply submit the link to your repo/pr by creating a new issue, hence you don't need to copy, paste and push your code to this repo.
